          Of all things which wisdom provides to make life entirely happy, much
          the greatest is the possession of friendship. It is not so much our
          friends' help that helps us, as the confidence of their help.
        </p>

        <p class="lead my-5">
          The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained,
          unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish,
          restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose
          that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what
          belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will
          lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods
          and men.
        </p>

        <p class="lead my-5">
          But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and
          what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever
          compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one
          or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will
          hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.

          Instead, you must entirely quit some things and for the present
          postpone the rest. But if you would both have these great things,
          along with power and riches, then you will not gain even the latter,
          because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely fail of the
          former, by which alone happiness and freedom are achieved.

          Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that of
          which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that to
          which you are averse. However, he who fails to obtain the object of
          his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his
          aversion wretched. If, then, you confine your aversion to those
          objects only which are contrary to the natural use of your faculties,
          which you have in your own control, you will never incur anything to
          which you are averse. But if you are averse to sickness, or death, or
          poverty, you will be wretched.

          Remove aversion, then, from all things that are not in our control,
          and transfer it to things contrary to the nature of what is in our
          control. But, for the present, totally suppress desire: for, if you
          desire any of the things which are not in your own control, you must
          necessarily be disappointed; and of those which are, and which it
          would be laudable to desire, nothing is yet in your possession. Use
          only the appropriate actions of pursuit and avoidance; and even these
          lightly, and with gentleness and reservation.
